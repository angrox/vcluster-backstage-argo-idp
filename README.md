# vcluster-backstage-argo-idp

This repository contains a setup for building an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) using idpbuilder. It combines tools like Kubernetes, ArgoCD, Backstage, Gitea, and External Secrets to create a self-contained environment for exploring GitOps workflows, developer self-service, and secret management. The [docs](./docs/) contain a workshop format for the setup so that every attendee can set it up for themselves. The [advanced setup](./docs/06_Advanced_Setup.md) spins up a local Kubernetes cluster with all components wired together through Git repositories managed in Gitea. Backstage acts as the central developer portal, where you can create and manage resources like Virtual Clusters with full visibility into their lifecycle via ArgoCD. This repo provides all the necessary configuration to bootstrap the platform, seed it with example applications, and explore real-world IDP patterns in a sandboxed, reproducible environment.
